		<p></p><p>A software enthusiast.<br><br>I have been working as a developer for around a decade. During this time, I got a chance to visit various domains and technologies, which helped shape how I think and work now.<br><br>I like to create software and help other developers like me around. I have recently been interested in making more layman talks than the geeky (development intensive). I believe everyone attached to a concept should have a right to completely and concisely understand it.<br><br>Some recent technologies I have been working on are NodeJS, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Electron, and others. My main focus is on problem-solving, irrespective of the platform.</p><p></p>
