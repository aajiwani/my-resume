        <p>A software enthusiast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working as a developer for around a decade. During this time, I got a chance to visit various domains and technologies, which helped shape how I think and work now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to create software and help other developers like me around. I have recently been interested in making more layman talks than the geeky (development intensive). I believe everyone attached to a concept should have a right to completely and concisely understand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some recent technologies I have been working on are NodeJS, React, Docker, Kubernetes, Electron, and others. My main focus is on problem-solving, irrespective of the platform.</p>
